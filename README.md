## Assignment_2 : Code Quality and Testing
## Task Distribution
- **Ayush Yadav** -
  - Explore Lint and code quality metrics & duplication.
  - Implement ESlint.
  - Refactor the code to reduce the errors.
  - Explore testing to implement unit test.
  - Implement some unit test to cover methods of game.js.

- **Shishir** -
  - Explore code quality metrics tools.
  - Implement lint for CSS.
  - Refactoring the code.
  - Did unit testing of other parts of game.js using jest framework.

### Tools Used

- **ESLint**: A tool for checking JavaScript and HTML code quality using the `eslint-plugin-html` plugin.
- **StyleLint**: Ensures consistency and quality in CSS code across the project.
- **jscpd**: Detects and prevents duplicate code to maintain clean code structure.
- **Jest**: A testing framework for running unit tests to ensure code correctness.

| **Jest**      | `npm install jest --save-dev`                          | `npx jest`                    |


### Summary of Refactoring

- **HTML**: No refactoring required.
  
- **JavaScript**: Slight refactoring was done by:
  - Adding missing curly braces.
  - Removing unexpected trailing commas.
  - Breaking lines exceeding 80 characters.

- **CSS**: Refactoring involved:
  - Removing unnecessary quotes.
  - Converting fractions to percentages.
  - Shortening color hex codes.

- **JSCPD**: No duplicates were found in the initial code.

### Summary of Testing

1. **game.test.js**
   - **Test: should add event listeners to start and restart buttons**
     - **Description:** Verifies that event listeners for `click` are added to both the `startButton` and `restartButton`.
2. **resizeCanvas.test.js**
   - **Test: should adjust canvas size when window resizes**
     - **Description:** Checks if the canvas size is updated correctly when the window is resized.
3. **updateScore.test.js**
   - **Test: should update the score correctly**
     - **Description:** Ensures that the score is updated accurately based on game events or actions.
4. **liveDecreases.test.js**
   - **Test: should decrease lives when fruits are missed**
     - **Description:** Validates that the number of lives decreases appropriately when fruits are missed in the game.
5. **gameOver.test.js**
   - **Test: should trigger game over state when lives reach zero**
     - **Description:** Confirms that the game over state is activated when the playerâ€™s lives drop to zero.
6. **buttonEvents.test.js**
   - **Test: should trigger game start on clicking start and restart buttons**
     - **Description:** Ensures that clicking the `startButton` and `restartButton` triggers the appropriate event handlers and sets `isGameOver` to `false`.
7. **drawImage.test.js**
   - **Test: should draw images on canvas correctly**
     - **Description:** Ensures that images are drawn accurately on the canvas based on game logic.
8. **clearCanvas.test.js**
   - **Test: should clear canvas before redrawing**
     - **Description:** Verifies that the canvas is cleared before new drawings are rendered to avoid visual artifacts.
